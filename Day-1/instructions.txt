Day One – Post Instructions

Let’s make a test for ourselves. How well do we know aptitude?

Provide 15 questions to test our knowledge of aptitude.

Try all 15 questions without looking at the answers.

Just try without using the internet.

Even if you score zero, it is also acceptable.

All the best.
